Unfortunately, the code you provided is TypeScript, which is a typed superset of JavaScript, and cannot be directly converted to Python as they serve different purposes. TypeScript is used for declaring types and interfaces for JavaScript, while Python is a standalone programming language.

If you can provide more context or explain the functionality you want to achieve in Python, I'd be happy to help you write the corresponding Python code.
